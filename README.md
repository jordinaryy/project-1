# project-1

##Project Summary

The Clock project is a simple C++ program that shows time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats. It helps users see and change the time easily, which is useful for managing schedules.

##What I Did Well

I created a Clock class that organizes how to handle time. The class has clear methods for setting and showing the time, making it easy to read and understand.

##Areas for Improvement

##To make my code better, I could:

Add Input Checks: Make sure users enter valid time (like hours between 0-23) to prevent mistakes.
Separate Code Parts: Split the code into different sections for handling time and user input. This would help keep things organized and easier to work on later.
Add Time Zones: Allow users to see the time in different time zones, making the app more useful.

##Challenges and Solutions

The hardest part was figuring out how to change the time from 12-hour to 24-hour format correctly. I solved this by carefully working through the math involved and looking up examples online when I got stuck.
Support Network Resources
I’ve found some helpful resources, like:
Resources provided by my teacher.
Forums like Stack Overflow to ask questions when I run into problems.

##Feedback from friends to improve my code.

##Transferable Skills

The skills I learned, like using classes and handling input, will help in other projects and classes. These are important for more advanced programming tasks.
Code Maintainability and Readability

##I made my program easy to read and maintain by:

Using Clear Names: I named my classes and methods so it’s clear what they do.
Adding Comments: I wrote comments to explain tricky parts of the code.
Organizing the Code: I kept the code in a logical order, starting with class definitions and then the main function, so it’s easy to follow.
